Hello, this is my personal Tetris game (and my second game after Snake) that I have developed. 

This project is mostly completed, as I have all of the fundamental
rules of Tetris applied to it, all the different bricks, and the game is mostly functional.

There are still a few things I could add to my project, such as:

- A panel on the side of the screen that indicates which piece would spawn next
- Background music/sound effects
- A formal End Game screen/indicator
- A pause button
- A hold button (that allows you to store a piece that can be used later)

However, I have decided not to add all of these features into my game, as this was simply a personal learning experience and a fun project
that I worked on, and moving onto another project would be more beneficial for my learning.

There are also a few bugs that I have not fixed, such as:

- When rotating a piece and the newly rotated piece overlaps with another piece, the current piece will overlap with the already fixed piece and stop moving
- The end of the game doesn't end when the top is reached, but after placing 1-2 more blocks
- There are probably more bugs that I have not tested/discovered yet

Thank you for taking a look at my project!
